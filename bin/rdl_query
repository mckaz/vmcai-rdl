  Usage: rdl_query <query>

  Valid queries:

  Class#method - Display type of instance method
  Class.method - Display type of class (singleton) method
  (method type) - Display methods that have given type

  Method type queries follow the usual syntax for RDL types,
  but can also include `.' to match any type, and `...' to
  match any sequence of types. See the README.md file for more
  detail.
